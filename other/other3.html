                    I'ma feed you to the wolves
                    When you get nasty, back at me
                    But, baby, don't distract me
                    I'm a goner, I lost her
                    Like why the hell you wanna
                    Play me that way? You're bad, babe
                    You double-faced entendre

                    I'm a lover, not a fighter
                    But I'll light this place on fire
                    I want it, I'm on it
