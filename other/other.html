                    Maybe, it's the way you say my name
                    Maybe, it's the way you play your game
                    But it's so good, I've never known anybody like you
                    But it's so good, I've never dreamed of nobody like you
                    And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime
                    And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine
                    'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions
                    Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine
                    And I see forever in your eyes
                    I feel okay when I see you smile, smile
                    Wishing on dandelions all of the time
                    Praying to God that one day you'll be mine
                    Wishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time
                    I think that you are the one for me
                    'Cause it gets so hard to breathe
                    When you're looking at me, I've never felt so alive and free
                    When you're looking at me, I've never felt so happy
