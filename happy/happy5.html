                        I found a love, for me
                    Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
                    Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
                    Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
                    'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
                    Not knowing what it was
                    I will not give you up this time
                    But darling, just kiss me slow
                    Your heart is all I own
                    And in your eyes, you're holding mine
                    Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
                    With you between my arms
                    Barefoot on the grass
                    Listening to our favourite song
                    When you said you looked a mess
                    I whispered underneath my breath
                    But you heard it
                    Darling, you look perfect tonight
                    Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
                    She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
                    I found a lover, to carry more than just my secrets
                    To carry love, to carry children of our own
                    We are still kids, but we're so in love
                    Fighting against all odds
                    I know we'll be alright this time
                    Darling, just hold my hand
                    Be my girl, I'll be your man
                    I see my future in your eyes
                    Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
                    With you between my arms
                    Barefoot on the grass
                    Listening to our favorite song
                    When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
                    I don't deserve this
                    Darling, you look perfect tonight
                    Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
                    With you between my arms
                    Barefoot on the grass
                    Listening to our favorite song
                    I have faith in what I see
                    Now I know I have met an angel in person
                    And she looks perfect
                    I don't deserve this
                    You look perfect tonight
