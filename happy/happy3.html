                    Oh, there she goes again
                    Every morning it's the same
                    You walk on by my house
                    I wanna call out your name
                    I wanna tell you how beautiful you are from where I'm standing
                    You got me thinking what we could be 'cause
                    I keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true
                    Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
                    This is typical of love
                    Can't wait anymore, I won't wait
                    I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever
                    In my dreams you're with me
                    We'll be everything I want us to be
                    And from there, who knows?
                    Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
                    Or is that just me and my imagination?
                    We walk, we laugh, we spend our time walking by the ocean side
                    Our hands are gently intertwined
                    A feeling I just can't describe
                    All this time we spent alone, thinking we could not belong to something so damn beautiful
                    So damn beautiful
                    I keep craving, craving, you don't know it, but it's true
                    Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
                    This is typical of love
                    I can't wait anymore, I won't wait
                    Need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever
                    In my dreams, you're with me
                    We'll be everything I want us to be
                    And from there, who knows?
                    Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
                    Or is that just me and my imagination? (Whoa, oh)
                    Imagination (whoa, oh, whoa, oh)
                    Imagination (whoa, oh)
                    (Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, ooh)
                    In my dreams, you're with me
                    We'll be everything I want us to be
                    And from there, who knows?
                    Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
                    Or is that just me and my imagination
