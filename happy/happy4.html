                        Aren't you somethin' to admire?
                    'Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
                    And I can't help but notice
                    You reflect in this heart of mine
                    If you ever feel alone and
                    The glare makes me hard to find
                    Just know that I'm always
                    Parallel on the other side
                    'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
                    I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
                    Just put your hand on the glass
                    I'll be there to pull you through
                    You just gotta be strong
                    'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
                    I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
                    The vacancy that sat in my heart
                    Is a space that now you hold
                    Show me how to fight for now
                    And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
                    Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
                    You were right here all along
                    It's like you're my mirror (oh-oh)
                    My mirror staring back at me (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
                    I couldn't get any bigger (oh-oh)
                    With anyone else beside me (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
                    And now it's clear as this promise
                    That we're makin'
                    Two reflections into one
                    'Cause it's like you're my mirror (oh-oh)
                    My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me
                    Aren't you somethin', an original?
                    'Cause it doesn't seem merely assembled
                    And I can't help but stare
                    'Cause I see truth somewhere in your eyes
                    Ooh, I can't ever change without you
                    You reflect me, I love that about you
                    And if I could
                    I would look at us all the time
                    'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
                    I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
                    Just put your hand on the past
                    I'm here tryna pull you through
                    You just gotta be strong
                    'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
                    I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
                    The vacancy that sat in my heart
                    Is a space that now you hold

                    It's like you're my mirror (oh-oh)
                    My mirror staring back at me (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
                    I couldn't get any bigger (oh-oh)

                    My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me
                    Yesterday is history, oh
                    Tomorrow's a mystery, oh-ooh
                    I can see you're lookin' back at me
                    Keep your eyes on me
                    Baby, keep your eyes on me
                    'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
                    I'm lookin' right at the other half of me

                    My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me
                    You are, you are the love of my life
                    You are, you are the love of my life
                    You are, you are the love of my life

                    You are, you are the love of my life
                    You are, you are the love of my life
                    You are, you are the love of my life
                    Now, you're the inspiration of this precious song
                    And I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on
                    So now, I say goodbye to the old me, it's already gone
                    And I can't wait, wait, wait, wait, wait to get you home
                    Just to let you know, you are
                    You are, you are the love of my life
                    You are, you are the love of my life
                    You are, you are the love of my life
                    You are, you are the love of my life
                    You are, you are the love of my life
                    You are, you are the love of my life
                    You are, you are the love of my life
                    You are, you are the love of my life
                    Girl, you're my reflection, all I see is you
                    My reflection, in everything I do
                    You're my reflection and all I see is you
                    My reflection, in everything I do
                    You are, you are the love of my life
