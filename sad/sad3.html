                        I got my driver's license last week
                    Just like we always talked about
                    'Cause you were so excited for me
                    To finally drive up to your house
                    But today I drove through the suburbs
                    Cryin' 'cause you weren't around
                    And you're probably with that blonde girl
                    Who always made me doubt
                    She's so much older than me
                    She's everything I'm insecure about
                    Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
                    'Cause how could I ever love someone else?
                    And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
                    And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
                    Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
                    'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
                    And all my friends are tired
                    Of hearing how much I miss you, but
                    I kinda feel sorry for them
                    'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do, yeah
                    Today I drove through the suburbs
                    And pictured I was driving home to you
                    And I know we weren't perfect
                    But I've never felt this way for no one, oh
                    And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
                    I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
                    'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
                    Red lights, stop signs
                    I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
                    Can't drive past the places we used to go to
                    'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
                    Sidewalks we crossed
                    I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
                    Over all the noise
                    God, I'm so blue, know we're through
                    But I still fuckin' love you, babe (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
                    I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
                    And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
                    'Cause you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
                    'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
                    Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
