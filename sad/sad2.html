                        I can't write one song that's not about you
                    Can't drink without thinkin' about you
                    Is it too late to tell you that
                    Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
                    I'm in Toronto and I got this view
                    But I might as well be in a hotel room, yeah
                    It doesn't matter 'cause I'm so consumed
                    Spending all my nights reading texts from you
                    Oh, I'm good at keepin' my distance
                    I know that you're the feelin' I'm missing
                    You know that I hate to admit it
                    But everything means nothin' if I can't have you
                    I can't write one song that's not about you
                    Can't drink without thinkin' about you
                    Is it too late to tell you that
                    Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
                    I can't write one song that's not about you
                    Can't drink without thinkin' about you
                    Is it too late to tell you that
                    Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
                    I'm so sorry that my timing's off
                    But I can't move on if we're still gonna talk
                    Is it wrong for me to not want half?
                    I want all of you, all the strings attached
                    Oh, I'm good at keepin' my distance
                    I know that you're the feelin' I'm missing
                    You know that I hate to admit it
                    But everything means nothin' if I can't have you
                    I can't write one song that's not about you
                    Can't drink without thinkin' about you
                    Is it too late to tell you that
                    Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
                    I can't write one song that's not about you

                    Is it too late to tell you that
                    Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
                    I'm trying to move on
                    Forget you, but I hold on
                    Everything means nothing
                    Everything means nothing, babe
                    I'm trying to move on
                    Forget you, but I hold on
                    Everything means nothing if I can't have you, no
                    I can't write one song that's not about you
                    Can't drink without thinkin' about you
