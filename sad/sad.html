                    You've got a hold of me
                    Don't even know your power
                    I stand a hundred feet
                    But I fall when I'm around ya
                    Show me an open door
                    Then you go and slam it on me
                    I can't take anymore
                    I'm saying, baby
                    Please have mercy on me
                    Take it easy on my heart
                    Even though you don't mean to hurt me
                    You keep tearing me apart
                    Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
                    Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
                    I'd drive through the night
                    Just to be near you, baby
                    Heart open, testify
                    Tell me that I'm not crazy
                    I'm not asking for a lot
                    Just that you're honest with me
                    My pride is all I got
                    I'm saying, baby
                    Please have mercy on me
                    Take it easy on my heart
                    Even though you don't mean to hurt me
                    You keep tearing me apart
                    Would you please have mercy on me
                    I'm a puppet on your strings
                    And even though you got good intentions
                    I need you to set me free
                    Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
                    Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
                    Consuming all the air inside my lungs
                    Ripping all the skin from off my bones
                    I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
                    I would gladly do it twice
                    Consuming all the air inside my lungs
                    Ripping all the skin from off my bones
                    I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
                    I would gladly do it twice
                    Oh, please have mercy on me
                    Take it easy on my heart
                    Even though you don't mean to hurt me
                    You keep tearing me apart
                    Would you please have mercy on me?
                    I'm a puppet on your string
                    And even though you got good intentions
                    I need you to set me free
                    I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
                    I'm begging you, begging you, please, baby
                    I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
                    Ooh, I'm begging you, I'm begging you, yeah
